# Deep-Learning

Hello Visitor,

In this repossatory I included deep learning algorithm code in python. I included convolution Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network and LSTM model. It will take 80% data as training and 20% data as testing for each model. And I trained model incrementally not sequentially. The model first take 8760 rows as training input then it will increase the training input by 1440 after each itteration. By default model will run for 100 epochs.

Thank You
Greetings
